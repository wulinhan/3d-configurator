# @allin/studio

The merchant-facing authoring app. A merchant drops in a model, positions and
sizes its parts in real millimetres, decides which surfaces take which
colours and what costs extra, and publishes the two files their product page
needs: `manifest.json` and `model.glb`. No code on their side.

```
npm run dev       # Vite dev server
npm run build     # production build into dist/
npm test          # unit tests, then the browser test against dist/
```

## Shape

All product logic lives in `src/lib` as pure functions and is unit-tested;
the React layer (`src/ui`) renders state and routes events. The split is
deliberate: the UI is the least testable layer, so it is kept too thin to
hide bugs in.

```
src/lib/import-stl.ts     binary + ASCII STL, welds the triangle soup
src/lib/import-3mf.ts     zip + model XML: objects, components, build items,
                          composed 3×4 transforms, unit conversion
src/lib/import-glb.ts     standard GLBs: node TRS/matrix hierarchies baked in,
                          compressed/quantised inputs refused with advice
src/lib/import-model.ts   content sniffing, name normalisation, orientation
                          into canonical space (mm, Y-up, ground-centred)
src/lib/write-glb.ts      browser-portable GLB writer — publish output and
                          preview input are the same bytes
src/lib/manifest-init.ts  first manifest from an imported model
src/lib/manifest-edit.ts  every edit the UI can make. Each op either returns
                          a manifest that passes validateManifest, or throws.
```

That last invariant is the point of the file: the Studio structurally cannot
hand a merchant a broken manifest, because nothing invalid ever leaves the
edit layer. `test/edit.test.ts` re-validates the result of every operation.

## The preview is the embed

`src/ui/ViewerPane.tsx` renders with the embed's own `Viewer` class, fed by a
blob URL of the same GLB bytes `Publish` downloads. What the merchant sees in
the Studio is byte-for-byte what their customers will render — the two can't
drift, because they are one code path.

Edits re-run layout on the loaded meshes (`Viewer.setManifest`) instead of
recreating the viewer: placement and scale are mesh transforms, and browsers
cap live WebGL contexts, so rebuild-per-keystroke dies within a minute of
real use. When an edit moves the model outside the current view by more than
a 25% band, the camera refits while keeping the merchant's orbit angle.

## Sizing semantics

The panel shows real mm (raw bounds × scale); the manifest stores multipliers.
With **Lock proportions** on, setting one axis multiplies every axis by the
same ratio — preserving the part's current proportions, including a stretch
made earlier while unlocked. Unlocked, only the named axis moves. `scale` is
applied about the part's own centre (see the schema), so anchors, not scale,
decide where a part sits.

## Tests

```
test/import.test.ts   18 — every fixture generated in the test file, each
                      encoding a real-world quirk (binary STL claiming to be
                      "solid", 3MF component transform chains, GLB quaternion
                      node hierarchies, metre-unit exports)
test/edit.test.ts     32 — sizing arithmetic, anchor/cycle rejection, palette
                      ops, custom-colour and add-on pricing, camera framing,
                      immutability, and the everything-chained validity check
test/studio.smoke.mjs 22 browser assertions — the full merchant journey
                      against the production build, ending with the downloaded
                      manifest re-validated by the embed's validator
```

The browser test exists because two real defects passed every unit test: the
camera-refit baseline was initialised after the first oversized edit (so the
refit never fired), and the `frame()` method was silently shadowed by an
instance field of the same name — `hasFrame: 'number'`. Both were only
visible with pixels on screen.
